  <p class="fw-bold">5. TikTok Pixel (Analytics and Advertising)</p>
  <p>
    We use the TikTok Pixel, a web analytics tool provided by TikTok Technology Limited, 10 Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, D02 T380, Ireland.

    IP address (in shortened form)

    device and browser information

    pages visited and interactions

    referrer URL and timestamp

    We have disabled Automatic Advanced Matching (AAM), meaning that no personal identifiers (such as email addresses or phone numbers) are scanned or transmitted.

    TikTok processes this data in pseudonymized form for statistical and advertising purposes in accordance with its Privacy Policy
    . Data may be transferred to servers in the EU and, in some cases, to the United States.

    Legal basis:

    If you give your consent: Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR / Art. 31(1)(a) revDSG.

    Without consent (Switzerland only): legitimate interest in analyzing and optimizing our advertising, Art. 31(1)(b) revDSG.
